Data structure problem list (leetcode)

Two pointers.

The two pointers technique is a powerful algorithmic strategy used to solve problems efficiently, especially those involving arrays, strings, or sequences. It is commonly used to solve problems with O(n) time complexity, making it much faster than brute-force approaches.

1. What is the Two Pointers Technique?
The two pointers technique involves using two pointers (indices) to traverse a data structure (usually an array or string) in a single pass. The pointers can move in the same direction or opposite directions, depending on the problem.
Key Characteristics:
●	Efficiency: Reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).
●	Space Efficiency: Uses constant space O(1).
●	Versatility: Can be applied to sorted or unsorted arrays, strings, and linked lists.

2. When to Use It?
Use the two pointers technique when:
●	The problem involves searching for pairs in an array (e.g., two numbers that sum to a target).
●	The problem requires comparing or manipulating elements in a sequence.
●	The problem involves subarrays or substrings (e.g., finding the longest substring without repeating characters).
●	The input is sorted, or can be sorted, to simplify the problem.

3. Types of Two Pointers Patterns
There are three main patterns of the two pointers technique:
1. Opposite Direction Pointers
●	One pointer starts at the beginning of the array, and the other starts at the end.
●	The pointers move toward each other until they meet.
●	Use Case: Problems like Two Sum, Palindrome Checking, or Pair Sum.
2. Same Direction Pointers (Sliding Window)
●	Both pointers start at the beginning of the array.
●	One pointer (the "fast" pointer) moves ahead to explore the array, while the other (the "slow" pointer) stays behind to track a valid window.
●	Use Case: Problems like Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Minimum Window Substring, or Removing Duplicates.
3. Fast and Slow Pointers (Floyd's Cycle Detection)
●	One pointer moves faster (e.g., two steps at a time), and the other moves slower (e.g., one step at a time).
●	Use Case: Problems like Detecting Cycles in Linked Lists or Finding the Middle of a Linked List.

4. Step-by-Step Problem Solving
Let’s solve a classic problem using the two pointers technique: Two Sum in a Sorted Array.
Problem:
Given a sorted array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers such that they add up to the target. Return their indices.
Example:
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1] (because 2 + 7 = 9)
Steps:
1.	Initialize Pointers:
○	left = 0 (start of the array)
○	right = len(nums) - 1 (end of the array)
2.	Traverse the Array:
○	While left < right:
■	Calculate the sum: sum = nums[left] + nums[right].
■	If sum == target, return [left, right].
■	If sum < target, move the left pointer forward (left++).
■	If sum > target, move the right pointer backward (right--).
3.	Edge Cases:
○	If no pair is found, return an empty array or handle it as required.
5. Tips and Tricks
1.	Sort the Array First:
○	If the input is unsorted, consider sorting it first. This often simplifies the problem and makes it suitable for the two pointers technique.
2.	Handle Edge Cases:
○	Always consider edge cases, such as empty arrays, single-element arrays, or no valid solutions.
3.	Visualize the Problem:
○	Draw diagrams or write examples to understand how the pointers should move.
4.	Practice Variations:
○	Practice problems with different patterns (opposite direction, same direction, fast and slow) to build intuition.
5.	Optimize for Space:
○	The two pointers technique is already space-efficient, but always ensure you’re not using extra space unnecessarily.
